          <h1>About the portfolio</h1>
          <p>The Caltech SIF does not publish an exact list of its securities, nor a day-by-day valuation of net worth. However, current value of all assets and cash is roughly $700,000. Our cash holdings fluctuate between 5 and 10 percent of total worth; we have positions in forty companies, with an average position-per-company near $12,500.</p>
          <p>The operation of the fund is dictated by a strict set of <a href="bylaws.pdf" style="color: #DDD; text-decoration:underline; font-weight:bold" target="newtab">bylaws</a> originally established in the 1970s; although these have since been amended, we are excluded from certain actions, including actions with unlimited downside risk. As this is the case, our holdings are comprised entirely of cash and publically-traded securities. We may circumvent some restrictions on commodity trading and other unconventional investment strategies by purchasing special exchange-traded stocks such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange-traded_fund" style="color: #DDD; text-decoration:underline; font-weight:bold" target="newtab">ETFs,</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market_index_future" style="color: #DDD; text-decoration:underline; font-weight:bold" target="newtab"">index futures</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VIX" style="color: #DDD; text-decoration:underline; font-weight:bold" target="newtab">volatility indices</a>.</p>
          <p>Because the expertise of the members of the Caltech Student Investment Fund tends to focus around the high-tech sector, we are more heavily invested in this sector (as a fraction of our total portfolio) than similar student investment funds may be. Regardless of this, we attempt to diversify our portfolio and spread our assets into many major sectors other than Technology including Basic Materials, Chinese Microcaps, Conglomerates, Consumer Goods, Energy, Finance, Health, and Retail.</p>
